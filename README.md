A pixel art tool, built with React and the HTML5 Canvas.

*A work-in-progress...*

[Try it out!](http://redraw.reidmitchell.net)

## Bugs to fix

## Improvements to make

- [x] Allow save/export of canvas to file
  - [ ] Actually resize PNGs based on pixel scale
- [ ] Custom colors/color palettes
- [ ] Eyedropper tool
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for all buttons/tools
- [ ] Automatically save canvas data to local storage
- [ ] Allow resizing of canvas
- [ ] Mobile layout
- [ ] Optimize exported SVG sizes
