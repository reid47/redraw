# redraw

A pixel art tool, built with React and the HTML5 Canvas.

*A work-in-progress...*

[Try it out!](http://redraw.reidmitchell.net)

## Bugs to fix

- [ ] On Edge/IE, pixels are blurry in the canvas (because CSS `image-rendering` doesn't work)

## Improvements to make

- [ ] Use select tool to save part of canvas
- [ ] Custom colors/color palettes
- [ ] Eyedropper tool
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for all buttons/tools
- [ ] Automatically save canvas data to local storage
- [ ] Allow resizing of canvas
- [ ] Mobile layout
- [ ] Optimize exported SVG sizes
- [ ] Improve + localize save modal text
- [ ] Disable all other inputs/buttons when modal is open
